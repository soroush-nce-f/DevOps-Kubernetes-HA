How to ask for input in shell script from terminal?

**First and simple example**

First we need to write our script, in order to do this, we can open a terminal, then use this code to open vscode
touch [File name].sh
 ls
 code .

### script###

	#!/bin/bash
	# Ask the user for their name
	echo Hello, who am I talking to?
	read varname
	echo It's nice to meet you $varname
###########

in the next step open a terminal in vscode and just remember that we should be in the same directory which script is located

## run the script

bash [file name].sh


the desired output will be something like below

Hello, who am I talking to?
Ryan
It's nice to meet you Ryan


--------------------
You are able to alter the behaviour of read with a variety of command line options. (See the man page for read to see all of them.) Two commonly used options however are -p which allows you to specify a prompt message and -s which makes the input silent. This can make it easy to ask for a username and password combination like the example below:

Second example/ login

	#!/bin/bash
	# Ask the user for login details
	read -p 'Username: ' uservar
	read -sp 'Password: ' passvar
	echo
	echo Thankyou $uservar we now have your login details


#### run ###
bash login.sh

output
Username: soroush
Password: 
Thankyou soroush we now have your login details



third example/ car
	#!/bin/bash
	# Demonstrate how read actually works
	echo What cars do you like?
	read car1 car2 car3
	echo Your first car was: $car1
	echo Your second car was: $car2
	echo Your third car was: $car3

DOTIN\so.novin@novin159:~$ bash car.sh
What cars do you like?
prado Bimmerm4 MercedesS500
Your first car was: prado
Your second car was: Bimmerm4
Your third car was: Mercedess500
DOTIN\so.novin@novin159:~$
